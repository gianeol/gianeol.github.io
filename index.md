## Hi! I'm Giane de Oliveira Lopes,
## a Freelance Webdesigner

### What I'm currently doing:

I'm currently working for a client that asked me to customize a pre-built theme, so the whole portal would have a consistent view no matter which area the users browse.

### What I did previously:

**2019 (1st semester)** - Marketing Campaign Pages for an online store. I've built specific pages for a Black Friday campaign for a retail store in Brazil. Once the pages were ready they were sent through several marketing channels and I also plugged the Google Analystics Infrastructure to keep track of the Visitors.

**2018 (2nd semester)** - Wordpress customization. A client from the construction industry asked me to customize his wordpress site. I was responsible for making the site look like some Zeppelin mocks, it took me several months to get this job done since I also had to fix some bugs in the underlying code.

**2018 (1st semester)** - Template customization for an online pharmacy. The client didn't have a website for his online pharmacy, I was responsible to pick up a suitable template and customize it accordingly to the needs of the client. The code to make the online store to work was built by another developer in php.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gianeol/gianeol.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gianeol/gianeol.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
